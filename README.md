ML Kaggle Project
This repository contains code for a machine learning project developed to analyze and model data from Kaggle. The primary code is contained in a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file, which must be executed sequentially to reproduce the results.

Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following installed:

Python (version 3.8 or higher)
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

Installation
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone (repo link)
cd your-repo-name

Instructions for Reproducing the Code
The Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) needs to be executed line by line to reproduce the results. Follow these steps:

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the notebook file (notebook_name.ipynb) in the Jupyter Notebook interface.

Run the Notebook:

Execute each code cell sequentially. Do not skip cells as the execution order is important for maintaining the workflow and variable states.
Important Notes:

Ensure the dataset files are correctly placed in the data/ directory before running the notebook.
Check the first cell for any specific configurations or paths you need to update.
